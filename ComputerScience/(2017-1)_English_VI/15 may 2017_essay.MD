## Introduction
Public art is fine and dandy but lately it's ultimate goal it's not clear nor their objective. Let's take the example of two pieces of ___art___ which can be found on the Main Campus of University of Talca. First one is made by Marcela María Correa Maturana and the other one is made by José Vicente Gajardo. Both of them are Chilean _artists_ used stone as their medium while using a very strange and abstract genre. While there are some differences between Correa and Gajardo works, the similarities with works of other people like are very striking, which leads us to the question: Is art a mistake on this day and age?

## Medium used
Both of our artists have used stone as their medium. Whilst the material is unkown it is safe to assume that there are some work involved sculpting it. 

Still, despite using the same medium, both works do not share the same appeareance as one is entirely supported by the land on it, the other has one of their pieces on top of a bigger one, giving some illusion of balance.
